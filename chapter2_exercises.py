# Problem 2.1
# To display 01, 010, 0100, and 01000, they would be displayed like this:
# >>> '01'
# >>> '010'
# >>> '0100'
# >>> '01000'
# there needs to be a quote around numbers because they are a sting, not and integer.

# Problem 2.2
#print 1
#x = 2
#print x
#5
#x = 5

# nothing happens because we are not pushing. In the terminal, x + 5 = 6. 

# Problem 2.3
# 1: 8
# 2: 8.5
# 3: 4.0
# 4: 11
# 5: '.....'
